# AFM_emulator
Emulate high speed scanning Atomic Force Microscopy images from molecular structures
---
Calculate hsAFM images given a molecular system. This has been built to image SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 
    positioned on mica surface, therefore many options pertain to that. Nevertheless, this can be wasily adopted
    to any protein of interest or trajectory thereof.
