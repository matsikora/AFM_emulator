# AFM_emulator
Emulate high speed scanning Atomic Force Microscopy images from molecular structures
---
Calculate hsAFM images given a molecular system. This has been built to image SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 
    positioned on mica surface, therefore many options pertain to that. Nevertheless, this can be wasily adopted
    to any protein of interest or trajectory thereof.
    
    
Example run is included at the bottom of the script. Should produce something like that:
